# Drawing machine
This program I made using Processing 3. It creates a set of rotating vector witch combined draws a continuous line representing the image. The target path is defined with coordinates in .txt files in the /paths folder.

## Demostration
[My Game of Life with glow effect](/screenshots/triangle4.png?raw=true)
The program is here trying to represent a triangle with the sum of 4 rotating vectors.

If we increase the vector count to 20 the line drawn by the vectors is much closer to the target path.

The program can also approximate more complex paths such as this image of a car. In this case, the program uses 114 vectors.
