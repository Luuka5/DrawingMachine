# Drawing machine
This program I made using Processing 3. It creates a set of rotating vector witch combined draws a continuous line representing the image. The target path is defined with coordinates in .txt files in the /paths folder.

## Demostration
![Triangle drawn with 4 rotating vectors](/screenshots/triangle4.png?raw=true)
The program is here trying to represent a triangle with the sum of 4 rotating vectors.

![Triangle drawn with 20 rotating vectors](/screenshots/triangle20.png?raw=true)
If we increase the vector count to 20 the line drawn by the vectors is much closer to the target path.

![Car drawn with 114 rotating vectors](/screenshots/car114.png?raw=true)
The program can also approximate more complex paths such as this image of a car. In this case, the program uses 114 vectors.

## How to run
1. Download and install Processing 3.5.4 from https://processing.org/download/.
2. download this repository.
3. Open any of the .pde files in this repository with Processing.
4. Click run.
